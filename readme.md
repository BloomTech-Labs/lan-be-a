### Tech Stack

`Express`
`PostgreSQL`
`React`

### Installation

Make sure you have [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository with `git clone`.

2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

3. Create a `.env` file and set your environment variables (LinkedIn tokens will need to be provided). It should look like this:

   1. "DATABASE" should be the name you give your **_database_** (not your server) in pgAdmin
   2. "USER" should match the "username" when you create your database
   3. "PASSWORD" should match the password for your database

```
DATABASE=yourdatabase
USER=youruser
PASSWORD=yourpassword
LAN_TOKEN=anythinggoeshere
SESSION_SECRET=bagelsinthewind
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=786t2e05bh0c2d
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=P6uAEw94o9jNOMaE
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset
```

4. Create a database in PostgreSQL (and make sure you have pgAdmin).cd

5. Update `DATABASE`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `CLOUDINARY_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` and `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` in `.env` with your credentials.

6. Run the Knex migrations with `npx knex migrate:latest`.

7. Run the Knex seeds with `npx knex seed:run`.

8. Run the server with `npm run server`.

9. In pgAdmin, find the query tool and set your role to admin with:

```sql
update users set role_id = 3 where id='your_user_id'
```

### Environment Variables

`SESSION_SECRET`
`DATABASE`
`USER`
`PASSWORD`
`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`
`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET`
`LAN_TOKEN`

### If encountering prettier/eslint errors run script in terminal:

`npm run lint`
